# Serverside-Authentication
Some old PHP scripts I made to get basic serverside account authentication working for an old Android app that no longer exists. The client Java code will be uploaded into another repo.

The app was a diet tracker, so there is some information in the scripts related to an account's body weight/height and other metrics.
